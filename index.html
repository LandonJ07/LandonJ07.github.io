            <strong>Mission Statement</strong>
            My main goal in life is to become a software engineer. I am a Computer Science major and have always wanted to be a software engineer. I have always enjoyed coding and I love the aspect of creating an entire algorithm just from code.
          </p>

          <p>
            In life, I want to accomplish graduating college first. That would be my first milestone. On the way I would like to meet a lot of great people who have a positive influence on my life and my journey throughout college. I would want to get into a job I actually enjoy and I want loving friends and family in my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some words people would use to describe me are hard working and caring. I would admit to get easily distracted but when I am focused on an activity I really enjoy then I am really concentrated and won’t stop working. I am definitely considered a problem solver and won’t take the easy way out of a problem and I will actively search for a solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some words people would say about me at my funeral or when I retire is that I am a very diverse thinker and I find many ways to solve one problem. People would say that I am a very hard worker and that I care about my work environment and the people around me.

          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>
            College students often struggle to manage time effectively between classes, studying, and personal life,
            leading to stress and missed deadlines.
          </p>
          <p>
            This card shows my CSCE 190 Problem Statement assignment. The screenshot below is from my completed Google Doc.

            This affinity diagram breaks the problem into groups: <em>Responsibilities</em>, <em>Symptoms</em>,
            <em>Causes</em>, and <em>Consequences</em>. Clustering ideas this way helps reveal patterns and guides
            design decisions for a time-management solution.

            These sketches visualize key screens for the app: a daily dashboard for tracking classes and tasks,
            a focus timer for productive studying, and a study-group finder to coordinate with classmates.
